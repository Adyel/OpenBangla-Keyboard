*OpenBangla Keyboard* is an OpenSource, Unicode compliant Bengali Input Method for GNU/Linux systems.
It's a full fledged Bengali input method with typing automation tools, includes many famous typing methods such as Avro Phonetic,
Probhat, Munir Optima, National (Jatiya) etc.

Most of the features of https://www.omicronlab.com/avro-keyboard.html[Avro Keyboard] are present in OpenBangla Keyboard. 
So Avro Keyboard users will feel at home with OpenBangla Keyboard in Linux.

== Installing

WARNING: If you had installed OpenBangla Keyboard 1.2.0 or earlier version, please uninstall it first. Make sure you have a **working internet connection**. Your package manager might need to download dependencies when installing.

Open your terminal and run this command on your bash shell. NB : It has to be **BASH**, otherwise it won't work.
```bash
bash -c "$(wget -q --show-progress  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

If this does not workout for you please create an https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard/issues[Issue]. While we look into the problem you can check the https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard/wiki/Installing-OpenBangla-Keyboard[Wiki] for Distrowise/Distro-specific Install Instructions. After you have installed OpenBangla Keyboard, you will need to https://github.com/OpenBangla/OpenBangla-Keyboard/wiki/Configuring-Environment[configure your desktop environment].

== Admonitions

Admonitions are handy blocks that are rendered seperate from the rest of the content. This is really helpful for explaining something that doesn't quite fit the flow, but you need to get the readers' attention. The `ifdef` portion and the rest of the lines that start with `:` go in your header.

The pre-processor directive `ifdef` checks to see if the GitHub environment is being used. To account for the opposite, create a block using `ifndef`. You can look at the header of this document to see how I managed it for this document.

[NOTE]
====
A sample note admonition.
We can use gemoji icons in the Asciidoctor markup.
We assign an icon name to the document
attributes `tip-caption`, `note-caption` and `important-caption`.
====
 
TIP: It works!
 
IMPORTANT: Asciidoctor is awesome, don't forget!
 
CAUTION: Don't forget to add the `...-caption` document attributes in the header of the document on GitHub.
 
WARNING: You have no reason not to use Asciidoctor.

== Images 

Images work as you would expect using the normal image syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::my_filename.png[]
----

You can also give an absolute URL:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3137042?v=3&s=200[]
----

There is a caveat, however. In order for them to be rendered inline, you must provide an absolute path to the `:imagesdir:` directive. On GitHub this consists of a full _HTTPS_ path to the image's parent directory. Once you have all of your images uploaded into your repository, look at the raw link for one of the images. Select just the directory portion of the URL and put that into:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\ifdef::env-github[]
:imagesdir: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/path/to/gist/revision/dir/with/all/images
\endif::[]
----

NOTE: When writing a Gist, all files must be in a single, flat directory. To upload images, you must first create a file in the Gist and then you can clone it. Once you've cloned it locally, you can add anything you like as long as you do not create any subdirectories.

== Callouts

Callouts are a great way to explain code segment and are, in fact, the one of the two main reasons I even looked into asciidoc (the other being the admonition blocks). Asciidoctor will place numbers in the code listing, which you can uses as references following the code listing.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[source]
 ----
\ifdef::env-github[] \<1> <1>
:imagesdir: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/path/to/gist/revision/dir/with/all/images
\endif::[]
\ifndef::env-github[] \<2> 
:imagesdir: ./
\endif::[]
 ----
<1> Use the `ifdef` to customize for online rendering <2>
<2> Use the `ifndef` to customize for offline
----
<1> Callouts in the body of the listing appear as either an icon or within parentheses.
<2> The block underneath allows you to explain the code sample without getting in the way

== What Next?
I'll add more comments here as I write and find interesting nuances. In the meantime, the link::http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor project] has _GREAT_ link::http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[user manual] and link::http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[Quick Reference]!
